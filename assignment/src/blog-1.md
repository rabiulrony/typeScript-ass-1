<!-- union type -->
By using union type we can select any one of multiple types. This brings flexibility to our code, i.e. a value can be of more than one type.
Union types bring flexibility to our code and allow us to work with multiple types.


<!-- intersection type -->
Using intersection type we can combine multiple types to form a new type. That is, the value of this type will contain all the properties of the type together. This ensures a strong type system in our code.
The intersection type creates a strong type system in our code, where multiple properties can be combined to form a strong type.
